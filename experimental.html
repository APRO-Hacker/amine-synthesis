        <h2>Synthesis Procedures</h2>
        <h3>Preparation of Benzyl Chloride</h3>
        <p>A 250 mL round-bottom flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar was charged with toluene (12.8 mL, 0.12 mol), TCCA (9.3 g, 0.04 mol, providing ~0.12 mol chlorine), and benzoyl peroxide (0.1 g, catalytic). The mixture was stirred at 25–30°C under direct sunlight or a UV lamp (15 W, 254 nm) for 2–3 hours to initiate radical chlorination. Reaction progress was monitored by TLC using a hexane:ethyl acetate (9:1) solvent system, with R<sub>f</sub> values of 0.8 for toluene and 0.6 for benzyl chloride, visualized under UV light (254 nm). The mixture was filtered through a sintered glass funnel to remove cyanuric acid byproduct. The filtrate was washed with 50 mL of 5% sodium carbonate solution, 50 mL of water, and 50 mL of brine. The organic layer was dried over MgSO<sub>4</sub> (10 g), filtered, and distilled (boiling point 178–182°C) to yield benzyl chloride (7.6–10.6 g, 50–70% yield).</p>
        <p class="reaction"><code>C6H5CH3 + TCCA → [TCCA, sunlight, benzoyl peroxide] C6H5CH2Cl + cyanuric acid</code></p>

        <h3>Synthesis of Phenylacetic Acid</h3>
        <p>A 250 mL three-necked flask, fitted with a reflux condenser, dropping funnel, and nitrogen inlet, was charged with magnesium turnings (2.92 g, 0.12 mol) in dry THF (50 mL, anhydrous). Benzyl chloride (10.6 g, 0.084 mol) in dry THF (30 mL) was added dropwise over 30 minutes, with a small iodine crystal to initiate the reaction if necessary. The mixture was refluxed at 66°C for 1 hour to form benzylmagnesium chloride. After cooling to room temperature, the solution was poured onto crushed dry ice (100 g, excess CO<sub>2</sub>) in a fume hood. The mixture was stirred for 2 hours until the dry ice sublimed. The reaction was quenched with 50 mL of 1M HCl, and the organic layer was separated using a 250 mL separatory funnel. The aqueous layer was extracted with 50 mL of ethyl acetate, and the combined organic layers were washed with 50 mL of water, dried over MgSO<sub>4</sub> (10 g), and filtered. The product was recrystallized from hot water to yield phenylacetic acid as white crystals (6.8–8.6 g, 60–75% yield).</p>
        <p class="reaction"><code>C6H5CH2Cl + Mg → [THF] C6H5CH2MgCl → [CO2, H+] C6H5CH2COOH</code></p>

        <h3>Preparation of Phenylacetone</h3>
        <p>A 100 mL round-bottom flask equipped with a distillation adapter was charged with phenylacetic acid (8.6 g, 0.063 mol) and acetic anhydride (30 mL, excess). The mixture was heated to 240°C in a sand bath for 2 hours, with acetic acid distilled off and collected in a receiver flask. The residue was cooled to room temperature, diluted with 50 mL of water, and neutralized to pH 7 with 50 mL of 1M NaOH. The mixture was extracted with two 50 mL portions of ethyl acetate using a separatory funnel. The combined organic layers were dried over MgSO<sub>4</sub> (10 g), filtered, and vacuum distilled (boiling point 100°C at 10 mmHg) to yield phenylacetone as a colourless liquid (5.1–5.9 g, 60–70% yield).</p>
        <p class="reaction"><code>C6H5CH2COOH + (CH3CO)2O → [Δ] C6H5CH2COCH3 + CO2 + CH3COOH</code></p>

        <h3>Reductive Amination to N-Methyl-1-Phenylpropan-2-Amine</h3>
        <p>A 100 mL round-bottom flask was charged with phenylacetone (5.9 g, 0.044 mol) dissolved in ethanol (30 mL). Methylamine was generated by mixing methylamine hydrochloride (4.0 g, 0.06 mol) with 60 mL of 1M NaOH in a separate flask and distilling the free methylamine gas into the reaction flask using a gas delivery tube. The mixture was stirred at 25°C for 1 hour to form the imine intermediate, monitored by TLC (hexane:ethyl acetate, 7:3, R<sub>f</sub> phenylacetone 0.5, amine 0.3). Sodium borohydride (2.3 g, 0.06 mol) was added portionwise over 30 minutes, and stirring continued for 4 hours. The reaction was quenched with 50 mL of 1M NaOH, and the mixture was extracted with three 50 mL portions of ethyl acetate. The combined organic layers were dried over MgSO<sub>4</sub> (10 g), filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator (or simple distillation if unavailable). The resulting free base was dissolved in ethanol (20 mL), treated with 10 mL of 1M HCl to form the hydrochloride salt, and recrystallized from ethanol to yield N-methyl-1-phenylpropan-2-amine hydrochloride as colourless crystals (5.7–6.5 g, 70–80% yield).</p>
        <p class="reaction"><code>C6H5CH2COCH3 + CH3NH2 → [NaBH4] C6H5CH2CH(NHCH3)CH3 → [HCl] C6H5CH2CH(NHCH3)CH3 · HCl</code></p>

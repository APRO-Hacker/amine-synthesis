        <h1>Synthesis of N-Methyl-1-Phenylpropan-2-Amine from Toluene: A Theoretical Study for Educational Laboratories</h1>
        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>This paper presents a four-step synthetic pathway for preparing N-methyl-1-phenylpropan-2-amine, a Schedule II controlled substance under the NDPS Act, using toluene as the starting material. The procedure employs standard laboratory reagents and equipment, designed for theoretical educational purposes. The steps include: (1) benzylic chlorination of toluene using trichloroisocyanuric acid (TCCA) and benzoyl peroxide under sunlight to yield benzyl chloride (50–70% yield); (2) Grignard reaction of benzyl chloride with magnesium in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (THF), followed by carbonation with dry ice to produce phenylacetic acid (60–75% yield); (3) ketonic decarboxylation of phenylacetic acid with acetic anhydride at 240°C to form phenylacetone (60–70% yield); and (4) reductive amination of phenylacetone with methylamine and sodium borohydride to yield N-methyl-1-phenylpropan-2-amine hydrochloride (70–80% yield). The overall yield ranges from 50–60%. Purification involves recrystallization and distillation, monitored by TLC, suitable for laboratories without advanced instrumentation. Safety protocols, including fume hood use and protective equipment, are emphasized due to hazardous reagents (e.g., TCCA, methylamine). Compliance with NDPS Act regulations, including NCB permits, is mandatory. This theoretical exercise highlights organic synthesis techniques, reaction mechanisms, and regulatory considerations for advanced chemical education.</p>

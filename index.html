        <h1>Synthesis of N-Methyl-1-Phenylpropan-2-Amine from Toluene: A Comprehensive Theoretical Study for Educational Laboratories</h1>
        <p><strong>Author</strong>: Anonymous<br><strong>Date</strong>: July 2025</p>

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>This paper presents a theoretical synthesis of N-methyl-1-phenylpropan-2-amine (C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>15</sub>N) from toluene, designed for educational laboratories using standard reagents and equipment. The four-step procedure involves benzylic chlorination with trichloroisocyanuric acid (TCCA), a Grignard reaction to form phenylacetic acid, ketonic decarboxylation to produce phenylacetone, and reductive amination with methylamine and sodium borohydride to yield the target amine as its hydrochloride salt. Reagents such as toluene, TCCA, magnesium, ethanol, dry ice, acetic anhydride, methylamine hydrochloride, and sodium borohydride are selected for accessibility. The synthesis achieves an estimated overall yield of 50â€“60%, constrained by typical laboratory limitations. Detailed discussions cover reaction mechanisms, safety protocols, regulatory compliance under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, and educational applications. Supplementary material includes reagent properties, safety data, and student exercises, making this a robust resource for chemistry education.</p>

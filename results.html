        <h1>Results and Discussion</h1>
        <h2>Yield and Product Characterization</h2>
        <p>The synthesis achieves an estimated overall yield of 50–60%, based on individual step yields: 50–70% for chlorination, 60–75% for the Grignard reaction, 60–70% for decarboxylation, and 70–80% for reductive amination. The final product, N-methyl-1-phenylpropan-2-amine hydrochloride, forms colourless crystals with a melting point of approximately 170°C, consistent with literature descriptions [3]. In educational laboratories, characterization is limited to physical properties (e.g., melting point, solubility in ethanol) and TLC analysis, as advanced instruments like NMR or HPLC are typically unavailable. Recrystallization from ethanol ensures high purity, though losses during distillation and extraction may reduce yields.</p>

        <h2>Detailed Reaction Mechanisms</h2>
        <h3>Chlorination</h3>
        <p>The chlorination of toluene proceeds via a free-radical mechanism. TCCA decomposes under sunlight or UV light, with benzoyl peroxide as a radical initiator, to release chlorine radicals. The benzylic hydrogen of toluene is abstracted, forming a resonance-stabilized benzyl radical, which reacts with chlorine to form benzyl chloride. The reaction is selective due to the stability of the benzyl radical, delocalized across the aromatic ring [2].</p>
        <p class="reaction"><code>C6H5CH3 → [Cl·] C6H5CH2· + HCl → [Cl2] C6H5CH2Cl</code></p>

        <h3>Grignard Reaction</h3>
        <p>Benzyl chloride reacts with magnesium in dry ethanol to form benzylmagnesium chloride, a nucleophilic Grignard reagent. The reagent attacks the electrophilic carbon of carbon dioxide, forming a carboxylate intermediate, which is protonated by HCl to yield phenylacetic acid. Ethanol, used instead of diethyl ether, reduces fire hazards but may form side products due to its polarity [4].</p>
        <p class="reaction"><code>C6H5CH2MgCl + CO2 → C6H5CH2COO^-MgCl^+ → [H+] C6H5CH2COOH</code></p>

        <h3>Ketonic Decarboxylation</h3>
        <p>Phenylacetic acid reacts with acetic anhydride to form a mixed anhydride, which undergoes thermal decarboxylation at 200–250°C. The reaction proceeds via a ketene intermediate, which rearranges to form phenylacetone, releasing carbon dioxide and acetic acid as byproducts [4].</p>
        <p class="reaction"><code>C6H5CH2COOH + (CH3CO)2O → [ketene] C6H5CH2COCH3 + CO2</code></p>

        <h3>Reductive Amination</h3>
        <p>Phenylacetone reacts with methylamine to form an imine via condensation, which is reduced by sodium borohydride to the secondary amine. Protonation with HCl forms the stable hydrochloride salt, suitable for recrystallization [3].</p>
        <p class="reaction"><code>C6H5CH2C(=O)CH3 + CH3NH2 → C6H5CH2C(=NCH3)CH3 → [NaBH4] C6H5CH2CH(NHCH3)CH3</code></p>

        <h2>Apparatus Descriptions</h2>
        <p>To ensure clarity, detailed textual descriptions of the apparatus setups are provided:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Chlorination</strong>: A 250 mL round-bottom flask with a magnetic stir bar, open to sunlight or a UV lamp (15 W, 254 nm), connected to a sintered glass funnel for filtration of cyanuric acid byproduct.</li>
            <li><strong>Grignard Reaction</strong>: A 250 mL three-necked flask with a water-cooled reflux condenser (vertical orientation), a dropping funnel for benzyl chloride addition, and a nitrogen inlet (via a balloon and rubber septum) to maintain an inert atmosphere.</li>
            <li><strong>Decarboxylation</strong>: A 100 mL round-bottom flask with a distillation adapter, water-cooled condenser, and receiver flask, heated in a sand bath to 250°C.</li>
            <li><strong>Reductive Amination</strong>: A 100 mL round-bottom flask with a magnetic stir bar, connected to a gas delivery tube for methylamine addition, and a 250 mL separatory funnel for extractions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Feasibility in Educational Laboratories</h2>
        <p>The synthesis is designed to use standard laboratory reagents and equipment. TCCA, a stable chlorinating agent, replaces hazardous chlorine gas [2]. Ethanol, widely available, substitutes for diethyl ether in the Grignard reaction, though its polarity may reduce yields. Dry ice, used as a CO<sub>2</sub> source, is accessible. Acetic anhydride and sodium borohydride are less common but can be sourced from chemical suppliers. The decarboxylation step requires high temperatures, which may challenge heating equipment (e.g., sand baths limited to 200°C). Vacuum distillation, needed for phenylacetone purification, is often impractical, as laboratories rely on simple distillation. TLC monitoring is feasible with silica plates and UV lamps, but precise yield measurements are limited without analytical instruments.</p>

        <h2>Safety Considerations</h2>
        <p>Each step presents specific safety hazards, requiring strict protocols:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Chlorination</strong>: TCCA is a strong oxidizer, and benzyl chloride is a lachrymator and potential carcinogen. Handle in a fume hood with nitrile gloves and goggles.</li>
            <li><strong>Grignard Reaction</strong>: Magnesium is reactive, and the reaction is moisture-sensitive, risking exothermic side reactions. Ethanol must be anhydrous to prevent hydrogen gas formation.</li>
            <li><strong>Decarboxylation</strong>: Acetic anhydride is corrosive, and high temperatures pose burn risks. Use a sand bath and fume hood.</li>
            <li><strong>Reductive Amination</strong>: Methylamine is flammable and toxic, requiring careful distillation. Sodium borohydride must be added slowly to avoid gas evolution.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All steps require supervision, proper ventilation, and adherence to safety protocols, including spill containment and waste disposal.</p>

        <h2>Legal and Ethical Considerations</h2>
        <p>N-Methyl-1-phenylpropan-2-amine is a Schedule II controlled substance under the NDPS Act [1]. Synthesis requires NCB permits, with detailed record-keeping and secure storage of intermediates (e.g., phenylacetone). Unauthorized production carries penalties of 7–20 years imprisonment. This paper is a theoretical exercise, and laboratories must consult regulatory authorities before attempting related experiments.</p>

        <h2>Alternative Synthetic Routes</h2>
        <p>Alternative approaches include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Chlorination</strong>: Chlorine gas or N-chlorosuccinimide are hazardous or unavailable [2].</li>
            <li><strong>Grignard Reaction</strong>: Diethyl ether or THF could improve yields but are less safe [4].</li>
            <li><strong>Decarboxylation</strong>: Calcium acetate or lead acetate yield lower and produce complex waste [4].</li>
            <li><strong>Reductive Amination</strong>: Catalytic hydrogenation requires high-pressure equipment [3].</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Reaction Kinetics</h2>
        <p>The chlorination step follows first-order kinetics with respect to toluene, with the rate dependent on radical initiator concentration and light intensity [2]. The Grignard reaction is limited by magnesium activation, while decarboxylation kinetics depend on temperature and anhydride excess. Reductive amination involves fast imine formation followed by slower reduction, with NaBH<sub>4</sub> concentration as the rate-limiting factor [3].</p>

        <h2>Purification Challenges</h2>
        <p>Purification in educational laboratories is limited by equipment constraints:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Distillation</strong>: Simple distillation (used for benzyl chloride and phenylacetone) may lead to product loss due to high boiling points.</li>
            <li><strong>Recrystallization</strong>: Effective for phenylacetic acid and the final amine, but requires optimization of solvent (e.g., hot water, ethanol) to minimize losses.</li>
            <li><strong>TLC</strong>: Provides qualitative monitoring but lacks precision without densitometry.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Optimization Strategies</h2>
        <p>To improve yields:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Chlorination</strong>: Use a higher-intensity UV lamp (e.g., 30 W) to accelerate radical formation.</li>
            <li><strong>Grignard Reaction</strong>: Dry ethanol thoroughly using molecular sieves to minimize side reactions.</li>
            <li><strong>Decarboxylation</strong>: Maintain precise temperature control (240°C) to optimize ketene formation.</li>
            <li><strong>Reductive Amination</strong>: Add NaBH<sub>4</sub> in smaller increments to ensure complete reduction.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Educational Applications</h2>
        <p>This synthesis can be integrated into a teaching module for advanced students, covering:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reaction mechanisms and kinetics.</li>
            <li>Laboratory techniques (distillation, recrystallization, TLC).</li>
            <li>Safety and regulatory compliance.</li>
            <li>Ethical considerations in chemical research.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Partial demonstrations (e.g., chlorination) can be conducted with oversight to avoid handling controlled intermediates. A student exercise is provided in the appendix.</p>

        <h2>Troubleshooting Tips</h2>
        <p>Common issues include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Low Yields</strong>: Ensure anhydrous conditions for the Grignard reaction and precise temperature control for decarboxylation.</li>
            <li><strong>TLC Issues</strong>: Use fresh silica plates and correct solvent ratios (hexane:ethyl acetate, 9:1 or 7:3).</li>
            <li><strong>Equipment Limitations</strong>: Optimize heating rates for simple distillation to minimize product loss.</li>
            <li><strong>Safety Incidents</strong>: Maintain spill kits and eyewash stations, and train students on emergency procedures.</li>
        </ul>

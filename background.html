        <h1>Background and Significance</h1>
        <h2>Historical Context of Amine Synthesis</h2>
        <p>The synthesis of secondary amines like N-methyl-1-phenylpropan-2-amine has deep roots in the history of organic chemistry. The Grignard reaction, developed by Victor Grignard in 1900, revolutionized organometallic chemistry by enabling the formation of carbon-carbon bonds through organomagnesium reagents [5]. Reductive amination, refined in the 20th century, became a versatile method for synthesizing amines from carbonyl compounds. The synthesis of N-methyl-1-phenylpropan-2-amine was historically explored for pharmaceutical applications, but its classification as a controlled substance has restricted its study to regulated environments [3]. This theoretical synthesis provides insight into the evolution of organic synthesis techniques and their adaptation for educational settings.</p>

        <h2>Chemical Properties of Toluene</h2>
        <p>Toluene (C<sub>7</sub>H<sub>8</sub>, molecular weight 92.14 g/mol) is a colourless, flammable liquid with a boiling point of 110.6°C, a melting point of -95°C, and a characteristic aromatic odour. Its benzylic position is highly reactive due to the resonance stabilization of the benzyl radical, making it suitable for radical halogenation reactions [2]. Toluene is commonly used as a solvent or reagent in organic chemistry experiments and stored under controlled conditions.</p>

        <h2>Types of Reactions Involved</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Radical Halogenation</strong>: Selective chlorination of toluene’s benzylic position using TCCA, initiated by benzoyl peroxide and sunlight or UV light.</li>
            <li><strong>Grignard Reaction</strong>: Formation of a carbon-carbon bond via organometallic chemistry, using magnesium and carbon dioxide.</li>
            <li><strong>Ketonic Decarboxylation</strong>: Thermal decomposition of phenylacetic acid with acetic anhydride to form a ketone.</li>
            <li><strong>Reductive Amination</strong>: Condensation of a ketone with an amine, followed by hydride reduction to form a secondary amine.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These reactions cover a broad spectrum of organic chemistry principles, making the synthesis an excellent teaching tool.</p>

        <h2>Educational Value</h2>
        <p>This synthesis serves as a comprehensive educational module for advanced secondary or undergraduate students. It demonstrates reaction mechanisms, laboratory techniques (e.g., distillation, recrystallization, TLC), safety practices, and regulatory compliance. The multi-step process illustrates the complexity of organic synthesis and the importance of sequential reaction planning, while the use of accessible reagents ensures relevance in resource-limited settings.</p>

        <h2>Regulatory and Ethical Considerations</h2>
        <p>N-Methyl-1-phenylpropan-2-amine is a Schedule II controlled substance under the NDPS Act [1]. Synthesis, even for educational purposes, requires permits from the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), with strict record-keeping and secure storage protocols. Unauthorized production carries penalties of 7–20 years imprisonment. This paper is a theoretical exercise to illustrate organic chemistry principles, and laboratories must consult regulatory authorities before attempting related experiments.</p>

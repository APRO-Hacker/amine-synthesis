        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Organic synthesis is a cornerstone of chemistry education, enabling students to explore the transformation of simple starting materials into complex molecules through controlled chemical reactions. The synthesis of N-methyl-1-phenylpropan-2-amine, a secondary amine, from toluene (C<sub>7</sub>H<sub>8</sub>) provides a comprehensive case study to demonstrate key organic reactions, including radical halogenation, organometallic chemistry, decarboxylation, and reductive amination. This compound, commonly known as methamphetamine, is a Schedule II controlled substance under the NDPS Act, necessitating strict regulatory oversight for any laboratory work, even in academic contexts [1]. The challenge lies in designing a synthesis that uses basic, safe, and accessible reagents while maintaining educational value and ensuring compliance with legal restrictions.</p>
        <p>Toluene, a widely available aromatic hydrocarbon, is an ideal starting material due to its availability and reactivity. Industrial syntheses of N-methyl-1-phenylpropan-2-amine often rely on hazardous or specialized reagents, such as N-bromosuccinimide, diethyl ether, or sodium triacetoxyborohydride, which are impractical for educational settings due to safety or availability issues [2,3]. This study proposes a four-step synthesis using reagents like TCCA (a pool disinfectant), magnesium turnings, ethanol, dry ice, acetic anhydride, methylamine hydrochloride, and sodium borohydride. The process includes:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Benzylic chlorination of toluene to benzyl chloride using TCCA under sunlight or UV light.</li>
            <li>Grignard reaction of benzyl chloride with magnesium and carbon dioxide in ethanol to form phenylacetic acid.</li>
            <li>Ketonic decarboxylation of phenylacetic acid with acetic anhydride to produce phenylacetone.</li>
            <li>Reductive amination of phenylacetone with methylamine and sodium borohydride, followed by salt formation with hydrochloric acid.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This paper provides a detailed experimental procedure, including step-by-step instructions, apparatus descriptions, safety protocols, and purification techniques. It explores the feasibility of the synthesis in a resource-limited laboratory, delves into reaction mechanisms, and addresses regulatory and ethical considerations under the NDPS Act. Additional sections cover historical context, alternative synthetic routes, reaction kinetics, purification challenges, optimization strategies, and educational applications. Appendices provide supplementary information on reagent properties, safety data, thin-layer chromatography (TLC) protocols, regulatory guidelines, sample calculations, and student exercises, ensuring a comprehensive resource for chemistry educators and advanced students.</p>
